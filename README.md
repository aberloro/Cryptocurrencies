# Cryptocurrencies

## Overview of Project

  ### Background
  Our client is interested in offering a cryptocurrency portfolio. To better understand what the portfolio would consist of, they have requested a report to identify current crypto market offerings as well as how the firm might group various cryptocurrencies into a classification system.   Unsupervised learning and the K-means algorithm will be leveraged to group the curptocurrencies. 

  ### Deliverables
   - D1: Preprocess the data for PCA
   - D2: Reduce dimensions with PCA
   - D3: Cluster cryporcurrencies with K-means algorithm
   - D4: Visualize cryptocurrency results

  ### Resources
   - Data Sources: crypto_data.csv
   - Technology: Jupyter Notebook, Python 3.7, Pandas, Plotly, hvPlot, skLearn

  ### Code
   - Please view [crypto_clustering](https://github.com/aberloro/Cryptocurrencies/blob/main/crypto_clustering.ipynb) for pre-processing, PCA, K-means, and plots
